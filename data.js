India was the only source of diamonds in the world for over 3000 years till diamond deposits were located in Brazil and South Africa.

No really large diamonds have come from this area.The most productive mines were in the 1860s and were found in Sakaria, around 32 kilometres (20 mi) from Panna. Four classifications were given to the Panna diamonds: first, Motichul, clear and brilliant; 2nd, Manik, with a faint orange tint; 3rd, Panna, verging in tint towards green; 4th, Bunsput, sepia coloured. Mines is situated in the interior of Panna district.
